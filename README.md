# regularise-and-symmetric-shapes
This project transforms 2D paths defined by point sequences into smooth, continuous curves. The aim is to ensure the curves are regular, symmetric, and complete, accurately representing the original paths while achieving smooth transitions and refined, visually appealing results.
